# WhatsApp-Conversation-Stats
Takes WhatsApp chat log (.txt) and plots charts of messages over time, colour coded by sender.

Graphing Options include:
  Chart types: Stack Plot, a Grouped Bar Chart, a Stacked Bar Chart, and a Line Plot.
  start and end date: Specify a date range for the conversation that you'd like to plot.
  Group messages: If you have that one friend who spams a thousand little messages at once, you can group these and count them as one.
  Bin size: If your WhatsApp chat has been going for a while, it might be too much to plot every day as a bar. Instead bin messages by week or month etc.


The code has been written to be easily editable and understandable for Python beginners to edit, thus I have skipped sanatising inputs.
