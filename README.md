# WhatsApp-Conversation-Stats
Takes WhatsApp chat log (.txt) and plots charts of messages over time, colour coded by sender.

Using Plotly allows the graphs to be built into an HTML page and shared. It also allows dynamic control of the graphs.

Options include a bar chart (bars can be stacked or grouped), and a stack plot.

Users can control the bin_size, grouping messages by day, week, month etc. This can help display lots of data.

Simply run main.py, arguments can be edited inside of main.py.
